# MacroUzaz – Custom 3x3 Macropad with OLED and Encoder

## 🔧 Overview

**MacroUzaz** is a fully custom 9-key macropad designed for productivity, media control, and creative customization. Built around the RP2040 microcontroller, this macropad includes an OLED display, rotary encoder with push functionality, and hot-swappable mechanical switches. It runs on the **QMK firmware**, enabling powerful and flexible keyboard layouts, macros, and animations.

This project served as a hands-on learning experience in electronics design, PCB layout, mechanical CAD, and embedded firmware development.
